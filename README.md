# Ski-Resort-Nearest-Lodge-Artificial-Intelligence

1) Developed search algorithms for finding the closest lodge to a Ski Resort using BFS, Uniform Cost Search, and A* algorithms.

2) Incorporated stamina as the only parameter for BFS and UCS and reinforced elevation change cost with momentum and stamina in the A* algorithm to minimize path cost.

3) Utilized heuristic functions to optimize algorithm performance on a dataset of varying ski resorts and achieved significant improvements in search speed and path cost compared to traditional algorithms.
